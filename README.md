A Mind Palace construction application that uses and manages your To-Do lists and notes.

This is in strict alpha phase.

Please find the attached "RunMe.sql" file on your SQL server to have the database running. Setup user account as mentioned above.

I have enjoyed the whole experience of highly intense coding sessions, long sleepless nights (2 nights) and almost "trance" states in which I used to think to overcome a bug or a particular task at hand. Thanks to WukiLabs for initiating such a great experience.
